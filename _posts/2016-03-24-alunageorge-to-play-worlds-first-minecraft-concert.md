A concert within Minecraft? There really may be nothing you can't do in this game.

Morgan Lee from Fact:

> “I’m sure they’ll be able to accommodate around 2,000 to 3,000 people, so this will have the same sort of feel as seeing a show in small concert venue,” said Erik Heisholt, the creative chief and founder of Heisholt Inc. and Gathering organizer.

When I ran a Minecraft server, it would choke when there was any more than 10 people on it, so I'm curious (and skeptical) to see how they'd pull off 2,000.
