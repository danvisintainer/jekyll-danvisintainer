Juli Clover at MacRumors:
> With Night Shift mode enabled, when the sun goes down, the iPhone's screen will automatically change towards the warmer (yellower) colors in the spectrum, reducing blue light. In the morning, the display automatically turns to its normal temperature color, mimicking natural daylight. 

Part of me wishes that Apple would just allow the great [f.lux](http://www.justgetflux.com) on the App Store, but hey - better than nothing, I suppose, and not a moment too soon.
