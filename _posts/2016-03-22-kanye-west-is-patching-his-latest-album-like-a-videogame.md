Dan Solberg on Kill Screen:

> Last week, in the second update Kanye made to The Life of Pablo (streaming exclusively on Tidal), he finally subbed in a new version of “Wolves,” now featuring more pronounced contributions from Sia and Vic Mensa. And this may not be the last update we see for The Life of Pablo either.

Never thought I'd see the day where effective patches would make their way to music albums.
