> To improve your experience, your feed will soon be ordered to show the moments we believe you will care about the most.
> The order of photos and videos in your feed will be based on the likelihood you’ll be interested in the content, your relationship with the person posting and the timeliness of the post. As we begin, we’re focusing on optimizing the order — all the posts will still be there, just in a different order.

Don't screw this up, Instagram.
