Before heading to my parents’ place for Christmas, I bought a game that prompted me to print out a 23-page PDF (it was also what I believe to be the only time I used a printer in 2015). The PDF turned out to be a “Bomb Defusal Manual,” an essential piece of the game.

[Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes](http://www.keeptalkinggame.com) is a game in which a player finds themselves in a room with a bomb with a ticking clock. The bomb consists of several different “modules” which can be made of colored wires, buttons, and other puzzles to solve before the time’s up. The bomb itself has no explanation whatsoever on how to correctly solve its puzzles. That’s where another player, the “expert,” comes in, using the manual I mentioned before. The manual explains each and every possible part of the bomb, offering detailed instructions on how to disarm it.

Here’s the catch, though: The player disarming the bomb cannot see the manual. And the player using the manual cannot see the bomb.

This turns the game into a test in fast, frantic communication. Can the bomb expert flip through the manual fast enough to find the right instructions? Can the defuser understand the expert’s instructions well enough to not mess them up? Every mistake made adds a “strike,” and each strike added speeds up the timer. As the timer gets closer to zero, the music gets more intense, only adding to the anxiety. It works extremely well.

The game has support for a VR headset if you really want to keep the bomb off-limits to onlookers, but the game works perfectly fine if the defuser is on a laptop. It’s also acceptable (and in many instances, better) if more than one person are on a team.

Play for long enough with the same people, and you’ll develop sublanguages and routines when approached with certain challenges. After about an hour or so, my dad and I had the keypad module down to a science.

Me: “Keypad. Got a lambda, curly Q, copyright symbol, and double-K.”  
Dad: “Hit the copyright symbol, curly Q, double-K, then lambda.”  
Me: “It’s good! Wires next - got a blue, two reds, and then a yellow.”  
Dad: “Two reds?”  
Me: “Yup.”  
Dad: “Last digit of the bomb’s serial number?”  
Me: “3.”  
Dad: “Cut the last red wire!”

For [$15 on Steam](http://store.steampowered.com/app/341800/) at the time of this writing, I consider this a steal for one of the best teamwork multiplayer experiences of the year. Pick it up and play with your friends and family - I guarantee you’ll have a great time.
