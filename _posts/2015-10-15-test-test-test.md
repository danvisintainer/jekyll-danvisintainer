Apparently you shouldn't start Jekyll posts with headers. But hey, what do I know?

## Anyway, this is a header or some shit.

# H1

## H2

### H3

#### H4

This is where I test all the shit, like **bold text**, *italicized text*, etc.

This is text. Text text text. Do you know what text is? Because it's right here. Lorem ipsum and all that shit. Nit tells me that I should use Hugo but I think I'll stick with this for now

`Inline code looks like this!` This isn't inline, `but this is!`

{% highlight ruby %}
def thingy()
    puts "Haven't done shit with Ruby in too long"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Okay syntax highlighting is a little weird because you have to surround it in liquid tags. It doesn't do GTM? **REALLY**?
