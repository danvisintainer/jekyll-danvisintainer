This is where I test all the shit, like **bold text**, *italicized text*, etc.

This is text. Text text text. Do you know what text is? Because it's right here. Lorem ipsum and all that shit. Nit tells me that I should use Hugo but I think I'll stick with this for now

`Inline code looks like this!` This isn't inline, `but this is!`

{% highlight ruby %}
def thingy()
    puts "Haven't done shit with Ruby in too long"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a regular-sized image:

Okay syntax highlighting is a little weird because you have to surround it in liquid tags. It doesn't do GTM? **REALLY**? [This is a link, you know](www.google.com)

## Here comes a list
- List 1
- List 2 
    - oh shit, an indented list!
        - more indents
            - and more
                - and more.

## What about ODERED lists
1. Here's a first thing
2. The second thing. Text text text text text text text text. I wanna see how wrapping works and stuff
    3. The third thing BUT INDENTED OH SHIT

## Here come blockquotes

> Jekyll is such a bitching blog language and stuff
