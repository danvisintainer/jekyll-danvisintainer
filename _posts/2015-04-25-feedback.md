**The Problem:** As a musician, I’ve found that making music with other musicians is quite difficult to do unless I’m in the same room as them. Yes, I know The Postal Service had their own method, but I wanted to see if there was a better way.

After two intense weeks at [The Flatiron School][1], Eric Fries, Matt Stines, and I have come up with (what we believe can be) a solution. Enter [Feedback][2].

The simplest description of Feedback that I can come up with is that it’s a multi-track audio recorder that’s used solely in your web browser. Once a project is made, a track is recorded and is then uploaded. Any subsequent track will then be recorded while the other tracks play, allowing the user’s new track to accompany the existing ones.

As more users contribute to the same project, its combined tracks could theoretically make up a complete song. Or you could just do what I did, and [make the THX sound with my voice][3].

## Built With New Technology

Feedback relies heavily on [Mozilla’s new Web Audio API][4] (given this, it’s odd that Feedback seems to work better in Chrome than in Firefox) to allow for audio recording and playback from within your web browser. Specifically, Feedback uses Matt Diamond’s great [Recorder.js][5] to record audio, and katspaugh’s awesome [wavesurfer][6] to display the waveforms on the page, as well as play them.

The Web Audio API is great! It’s also quite new, and thus not terribly well-documented, so much of our time was spent on studying the code of other projects already done… with some trial-and-error, too.

## Off-Notes

A project often isn’t without limitations, and Feedback is no exception. As of the time of this post, Feedback does not work in Safari &#8211; we recommend you use Chrome. We also wanted to keep this as simple as possible, so there is also no way to delete parts of tracks &#8211; you either add the whole track, or throw the whole track away. We just thought it’d be more fun this way.

## Finale

Feedback was incredibly fun to build &#8211; my next step is to send this off to the musicians I know, so they can give this a try themselves (and perhaps I can contribute a sax part or two). Working on this project played a big hand in expanding my JavaScript horizons, and I’m now interested in seeing how else I can take advantage of the Web Audio API for future projects.
