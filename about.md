I'm a Junior Front-End Web Developer at [SpinMedia](http://www,spinmedia.com) most of the time. Other times, I'm an amateur photographer, and sometimes a musician. At all times, I'm a coffee addict.

I first ran this site on Squarespace, then moved to WordPress, and now it's running on the great [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). You can expect me to update this blog once per whenever - and truthfully, you can expect me to update [my Instagram](http://www.instagram.com/danvisintainer) more than this.

This blog will likely be about photography, programming, music, and video games, as those are my interests.
