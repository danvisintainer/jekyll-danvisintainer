I'm a Junior Web Developer at SpinMedia most of the time. Other times, I'm an amateur photographer, and sometimes a musician. At all times, I'm a coffee addict.

I ran my site on Squarespace, then moved to WordPress, and now it's running on the great Jekyll. You can expect me to update this blog once per whenever.
